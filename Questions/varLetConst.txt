var declarations are globally scoped when they are declared outside of a function 

Hoisting moves variables to the top of their scope before undefined. 

when hoisted var declarations are initialized with undefined
var becomes a problem when you do not realize that a variable has already been defined before

let is block scoped
let can be updated but not re-declared 


const declarations are block scoped 
const cannot be updated or re-declared
props of a const object can be updated.

const and let declarations are not initialized when being hoisted
