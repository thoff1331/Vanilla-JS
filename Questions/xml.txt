XML -- Exstensible Markup lamguage 
markup langauge much like HTML
designed to store and transport data
desigbed to be self descriptive

It has sender information.
It has receiver information
It has a heading
It has a message body 

XML does not use predefined tags

It simplifies data sharing
It simplifies data transport
It simplifies platform changes
It simplifies data availability

XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed.

The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios.

Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation.

Element names are case-sensitive
Element names must start with a letter or underscore
Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
Element names cannot contain spaces


The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.

The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream, because you can:

Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background
