Model View Controller 

Models
 -- Models manage the data for an application.

 Views
-- Views are a visual representation of models that present a filtered view of their current state.

Controllers
-- Controllers are intermediaries between models and views, which are classically responsible for updating the model when the user manipulates the view.
